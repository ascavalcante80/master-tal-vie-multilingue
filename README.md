# master-tal-vie-multilingue
This was the first project realized during this master. As part of this project we conduct a research in quantitative and qualitative terms about the occurrences of one specific word – and its translations - in a multilingual corpus extracted from the web. This introductory exercise gave us the opportunity to discover the main basic NLP tasks such as web scraping and how to treat textual content using script programming Bash.
